# Fleetcor-Early-Account-Monitoring
# Fleetcor Project: Cross-Sell Early Account Monitoring  



## Overview  
This project analyzes customer behavior and financial performance to optimize **cross-sell opportunities** for Fleetcor. By evaluating transaction patterns and risk factors, we aim to **enhance revenue potential** while mitigating delinquency risks.  

---

## Business Objectives  
✔ **Understand Customer Performance**: Identify transaction behavior changes post cross-sell.  
✔ **Predict Risk Factors**: Detect key financial indicators affecting delinquency.  
✔ **Optimize Targeting**: Segment customers based on spending and stability.

## Dataset & Features  
The dataset includes:  
- **Customer Account Data**: Payment history, balances, and transaction patterns.  
- **Risk Indicators**: Credit scores, NSF payments, and write-offs.  
- **Transaction Metrics**: Spend distribution, delinquency rates, and performance segments.  

**Data Cleaning Steps**:  
- Null value handling 
- Standardization 
- Outlier detection 
- Feature engineering

## Methodology  

### Customer Segmentation (K-Means Clustering)  
- **Goal**: Group customers based on financial stability.  
- **Techniques**: K-Means, Elbow Method, Feature Scaling.  

### Transaction Pattern Analysis  
- **Goal**: Correlate spending, credit limits, and payments.  
- **Techniques**: Linear Regression, Boxplots, Log Transformation.  

### Risk Assessment & Performance Evaluation  
- **Goal**: Categorize accounts into **Safe, Medium-Risk, and High-Risk** groups.  
- **Techniques**: Threshold-Based Classification, Financial Metric Evaluation, Spend Percentile Segmentation.  

---

## Key Insights  
- **High-risk customers** show irregular spending and frequent delinquency.  
- **Transaction behavior** is strongly correlated with payment performance.  
- **95th percentile customers** contribute the highest revenue but require risk monitoring.  
- **Data-driven segmentation** helps target profitable cross-sell opportunities.

## Dashboard Insights  
### **Power BI & Tableau Visuals**  
- **Risk Score Distribution**: Identifies high-risk customers.  
- **Transaction Analysis**: Visualizes spend-payment correlations.  
- **Financial Performance Trends**: Compares pre- and post-cross-sell behaviors.
